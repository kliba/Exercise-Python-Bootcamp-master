<h1>List of Capstone Projects</h1>
<p>This list contains around 100 project ideas for you to try out in Python! Some of them are straightforward and others
    we
    have done before (such as a Fibonacci Sequence or FizzBuzz).

    Pick a simple project that you think you can finish in a day to start off with, then pick another project that you
    think
    will take you more than a week and extensive Googling!

    There are some sample solutions in this folder as well so feel free to explore and remember:</p>

<b> HAVE FUN!</b>
</div>


<h2>Graph</h2>
<b>Graph from links</b> - Create a program that will create a graph or network from a series of links.
<br>
<br>
<b>Eulerian Path</b> - Create a program which will take as an input a graph and output either a Eulerian path or a
Eulerian cycle, or state that it is not possible. A Eulerian Path starts at one node and traverses every edge of a graph
through every node and finishes at another node. A Eulerian cycle is a eulerian Path that starts and finishes at the
same node.
<br>
<br>
<b>Connected Graph</b> - Create a program which takes a graph as an input and outputs whether every node is connected or
not.
<br>
<br>
<b>Dijkstra’s Algorithm</b> - Create a program that finds the shortest path through a graph using its edges.
<br>
<br>
<b>Minimum Spanning Tree</b> - Create a program which takes a connected, undirected graph with weights and outputs the
minimum spanning tree of the graph i.e., a subgraph that is a tree, contains all the vertices, and the sum of its
weights is the least possible.
<br>
<br>
<h2>Data Structures</h2>
<b>Inverted index</b> - An Inverted Index is a data structure used to create full text search. Given a set of text
files, implement a program to create an inverted index. Also create a user interface to do a search using that inverted

<br>
<br>
<h2>Text</h2>

instead of the number and for the multiples of five print “Buzz”. For numbers which are multiples of both three and five
print “FizzBuzz”.
<br>
<br>
<b>Reverse a String</b> - Enter a string and the program will reverse it and print it out.

moved up or down. Optional: If GUI, the program can show green up and red down arrows to show which direction the stock
value has moved.
<br>
<br>
<b>Guestbook / Journal</b> - A simple application that allows people to add comments or write journal entries. It can

<br>
<br>
<h2>Security</h2>
<b>Caesar cipher</b> - Implement a Caesar cipher, both encoding and decoding. The key is an integer from 1 to 25. This
cipher rotates the letters of the alphabet (A to Z). The encoding replaces each letter with the 1st to 25th next letter
in the alphabet (wrapping Z to A). So key 2 encrypts "HI" to "JK", but key 20 encrypts "HI" to "BC". This simple
"monoalphabetic substitution cipher" provides almost no security, because an attacker who has the encoded message can
either use frequency analysis to guess the key, or just try all 25 keys
